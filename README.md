# Home

**Home** is a personal project and an experimental playground designed to showcase my profile while I learn various web development concepts and explore the possibilities offered by **GitHub Pages**. As a beginner in this field, my main goal is to create a space where people can find my name, get to know me better, and interact with some of my projects in a fun, creative way.

## Overview

This project serves two purposes:
1. **Learning**: It’s a hands-on experiment where I practice and apply fundamental front-end development skills such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while exploring how to use **GitHub Pages** for static site hosting.
2. **Profile Showcase**: It acts as an interactive online resume, allowing visitors to explore my work and contact me easily.

The site is built with four sections aimed at presenting my personal information, projects, and contact details while serving as a learning experiment on how to structure and deploy static websites.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 UP - Astral**: A base template I used to simplify the design process while learning about responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Used for iframe functionality and dynamic content loading.
- **CSS**: For design customization, enhancing my understanding of layout and style.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons and visual elements.
- **Formspree**: Used to handle the contact form, providing an easy way to integrate form submissions without needing a back-end server.
- **reCAPTCHA**: Added for extra security on the contact form, preventing spam.
- **GitHub Pages**: Used as the primary platform for deploying this static website.

## Key Features

1. **Personal Introduction**: 
   - The first section introduces my name and educational background.
   - Users can navigate through sections via the menu or by clicking an arrow.

2. **Interactive Iframe**:
   - The second section contains an iframe linked to a private repository that simulates a Wikipedia article about me.
   - Inside the iframe, users can explore a "blog" section that mimics a Windows XP desktop, where windows can be opened, minimized, and maximized to view my projects.

3. **Contact Form**:
   - The third section features a contact form powered by **Formspree**, making it easy for visitors to reach me.
   - **reCAPTCHA** is included to prevent spam submissions.

4. **LinkedIn Profile**:
   - The fourth section provides a direct link to my LinkedIn profile for anyone interested in further professional information.

## Learning Goals

This project is not only a profile site but also a valuable learning experience as I develop my web skills. Some key areas I’m focusing on include:
- Setting up and configuring **GitHub Pages** for static site hosting.
- Building responsive layouts using the **HTML5 UP** templates and customizing them with **CSS**.
- Integrating third-party services like **Formspree** and **reCAPTCHA** for secure form handling without a server.
- Working with **iframes** to load content from other repositories and exploring different types of embedded content.

## Installation and Deployment

The project is hosted on **GitHub Pages**, but you can also run it locally if you wish to explore the code:

### Local Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dnocitomerodio/home.git
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

**Note**: Some features, such as the iframe, won't function correctly locally since they rely on a private repository. The project is primarily intended for online use.

## Project Usage

The website serves as a simple, interactive resume and a space for me to experiment with different web development technologies. Users can explore the various sections and interact with the iframe-based simulation of a Windows XP desktop for a bit of fun, showcasing my learning efforts and projects.
